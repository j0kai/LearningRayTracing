# Learning Ray tracing

This repository is a record of my progress learning how to implement a basic ray tracer.

Uses https://github.com/TheCherno/WalnutAppTemplate as a template to make it easier to get started. Plan to do everything from scratch when I feel like I have enough of the required knowledge to do so.
